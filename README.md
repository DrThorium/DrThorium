## About Me
Hi, I'm Juan, a Data Scientist student at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Colombia. I've been passionate about computer science since I was a kid, and I am excited to learn more every day. I have worked with research laboratories, and my forte topic is the Colombian government on education issues. My interest is now focused on Machine Learning and data engineering.

### I work with:

Languages: C++, Python, Java, SQL.

**I invite you to look at my repositories to see some of my work.**
