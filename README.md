## About Me
Hi, I'm Juan, a Data Science undergraduate student (last year) with skills and experience in cloud development (GC & Azure), Data Analytics, and Machine Learning. I work with R Studio, Python, and C++ using solid statistical background knowledge including Econometrics.

**I invite you to look at my repositories to see some of my work.**
